# Modern browser viewer

Watch the existing Mineflayer bot in first-person (`/`), third-person (`/third/`)
or dungeon 2.5D (`/dungeon/`) view. The picture includes inventory, survival HUD,
received chat, a minimap and the renderer's game effects. It observes the existing
bot; it does not create another Minecraft login or run another LLM.

The October 2026 integration also relays original server particles, map pixels,
item-frame/held maps and native TextDisplay entities through the same bot
connection. Chinese TextDisplay glyphs use the original version-matched font
assets. Dungeon terrain visibility follows the upstream avatar-occlusion
logic. These rendering features do not add LLM requests or game commands.

The optional modern renderer currently requires **Node.js 22** and **Minecraft
Java 1.20.6**. The default configuration keeps visualization disabled and retains
the Prismarine viewer option. Modern viewer startup failures are logged without
preventing the game agent from initializing.

## Generate the browser resources

The frontend is [jcs130/mc-visual-console](https://github.com/jcs130/mc-visual-console),
an MIT-licensed project with portable browser source and offline resource tools.
The host adapter is included in this repository; generate browser code and
Minecraft resources from the [pinned renderer source](https://github.com/jcs130/mc-visual-console/tree/06ca0f166675d67a69422a0479b3aeb4d76604fd/packages/modern-viewer/renderer-src).
Its revision, source tree and license are recorded in
[`renderer-source.json`](../src/agent/vision/modern/renderer-source.json) and
[`RENDERER_LICENSE`](../src/agent/vision/modern/RENDERER_LICENSE).
The pinned runtime source and build tools match the renderer accompanying this
host adapter. The standalone frontend needs no Cortico checkout or service.
The shared repository includes a hash-checked Java 1.20.6 resource pack. The
following commands work in PowerShell or a POSIX shell; replace the output path
with a new directory for your deployment. This prepares the generic preset,
including particle/map resources and the original Chinese font ZIP.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jcs130/mc-visual-console.git mc-visual-console
git -C mc-visual-console checkout 06ca0f166675d67a69422a0479b3aeb4d76604fd
cd mc-visual-console
npm ci --prefix packages/modern-viewer/renderer-src
node tools/prepare-viewer-assets.mjs java-1.20.6 "/path/to/viewer-assets-new"
```

The output contains
`viewer-client.json`, `dist/`, `public/` and `render-assets/`; these generated
resources are not committed here. `viewer-assets.json` records the shared pack
manifest and original client JAR hashes; `viewer-client.json` records the browser
bundle and content/font hashes. The host checks that the manifests,
protocol version and generated bundle agree before accepting viewers.
Keep the same Minecraft version, preset and sound choice when updating an
existing deployment. Building the source does not update a previously copied
runtime directory: switch the configured directory, reload the viewer and
browser, and compare the served `/index.js` bytes with the recorded bundle hash.
Keep the previous directory for rollback. The frontend's
[Socket.IO contract](https://github.com/jcs130/mc-visual-console/blob/06ca0f166675d67a69422a0479b3aeb4d76604fd/packages/modern-viewer/renderer-src/SOCKET_PROTOCOL.md)
documents the game state consumed by the browser; the bundled adapter supplies
that stream from the existing bot.

For a resource export from your own installed client, follow the upstream
[resource and TextDisplay guide](https://github.com/jcs130/mc-visual-console/blob/06ca0f166675d67a69422a0479b3aeb4d76604fd/packages/modern-viewer/renderer-src/docs/text-display-bubbles.md).
A JAR-only block export does not provide the complete launcher font resources.

## Enable local viewing

In `settings.js`, or in the settings file already used by your deployment:

```js
"render_bot_view": true,
"viewer_type": "modern",
"viewer_port": 3000,
"modern_viewer_assets_dir": "/path/to/viewer-assets",
"modern_viewer_lan_address": "",
"modern_viewer_lan_prefix": 24,
"modern_viewer_max_sessions": 8,
```

On Windows, forward slashes work in absolute paths such as
`C:/minecraft/viewer-assets`. Start the agent normally and open
`http://127.0.0.1:3000/dungeon/`. Other viewpoints share the same port; each
additional agent uses the next port. The browser needs WebGL2.

Set `viewer_type` to `prismarine` to use the existing browser renderer instead.
The modern adapter loads its rendering dependencies only when enabled, and the
Prismarine option imports the browser transport without the package's headless
renderer entry point.

## Enable LAN viewing

Set `modern_viewer_lan_address` to the computer's actual LAN IPv4 address, for
example `192.168.1.20`, and set `modern_viewer_lan_prefix` to the subnet prefix
used by that network (usually `24`). Then open
`http://192.168.1.20:3000/dungeon/` from another device. Allow the chosen port in
the host firewall for your private network if required. Update the setting if
DHCP changes the computer's address.

The rendering host binds to loopback; a separate proxy binds to the chosen LAN
address and accepts clients from that subnet. It checks Host and Origin,
forwards the viewer's HTTP and Socket.IO traffic, removes forwarded/control
headers, and blocks capture-lease management from LAN clients. Viewing adds no
remote game-control endpoint. The project's existing agent-control WebSocket is
separate and its binding is unchanged by this feature.

`modern_viewer_max_sessions` is shared by all local/LAN viewing pages and all
viewpoints (default 8, integer 1–16). Each page consumes one slot; closing a page
releases it. Capture retains its separate limit of one. `/healthz` reports the
current and maximum counts. A healthy HTTP response alone does not prove that
the bot is moving or that browser rendering has succeeded.

## Optional game sound

Sound is optional and stays disabled when matching resources are absent. To
include the shared pack's sounds, add `--sounds` to the preparation command.
Alternatively, export your matching launcher cache from the renderer source
directory:

```sh
node tools/export-minecraft-viewer-sounds.mjs "/path/to/versions/1.20.6/1.20.6.json" "/path/to/launcher/assets" "/path/to/viewer-assets"
```

The exporter reads the local launcher cache. The renderer disables numbered
sound events when the matching registry is missing. Browser interaction is
required to allow playback. Cortico speech overlays, host speech relays and
livestream overlays are excluded from this adapter. Native server TextDisplay
entities remain visible; they are a separate game protocol feature.

## Validation and maintenance

The tests need the project's npm dependencies but no Minecraft server, model,
client JAR or GPU. Their synthetic resources exercise the host and socket
transport; they do not validate browser pixels.

```sh
node --test test/browser_viewer.test.mjs test/modern_viewer.test.mjs test/viewer_lan_proxy.test.mjs test/modern_vision_capture.test.mjs
```

With a real agent online and four free viewing slots, check streaming and slot
reuse without sending game actions or model requests:

```sh
node scripts/verify-modern-viewer-sessions.mjs http://127.0.0.1:3000
node scripts/verify-modern-viewer-sessions.mjs http://192.168.1.20:3000
```

The vendored `src/agent/vision/modern/host.mjs` is bundled from MIT-licensed
Cortico sources, plus the shared renderer's content bridge and bounded asset
server. `LICENSE` and `source.json` record Cortico's revision and inputs;
`RENDERER_LICENSE`, `renderer-source.json` and the nested `source.json.renderer`
record the shared source revision, tree and host inputs. The bundle hash covers
the combined result. To rebuild the host, prepare the recorded Cortico checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jcs130/Cortico.git cortico-viewer-source
git -C cortico-viewer-source checkout f0db612ce5075287330ab3e095ffa449c6e8e71c
cd cortico-viewer-source
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Then return to this repository's root and run:

```sh
node scripts/import-modern-viewer.mjs "/path/to/cortico-viewer-source" "/path/to/mc-visual-console"
```

Review the source revision and regenerated diff together. The importer removes
the speech/stream overlay and makes viewing slots configurable; it fails if the
expected upstream transformation points have changed. Both source checkouts
must have clean tracked input files. The importer records both pins automatically,
subscribes each accepted viewer to one shared content bridge, and releases it on
close or bind failure. It removes the legacy particle listener to avoid rendering
one packet twice.

When updating either source, check the frontend's Socket.IO contract against the
host, regenerate the host, and rebuild and verify browser assets. Keep source
updates separate from unrelated Cortico gameplay changes. See the
[October 10 integration verification](viewer-upstream-update-2026-10-10.md).

Map decorations, native particle physics parity, Java pixel parity and arbitrary
modded entity rendering are not claimed. The integration tests use synthetic
protocol packets; real server effects need observation in that server session.
